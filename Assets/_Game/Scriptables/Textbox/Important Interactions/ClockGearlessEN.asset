    TextList:
    - This shelf has some books and magazines. But also has my dad's favorite clock.
    - I don't know exactly how old it is, but it's here since my first memories.
    - Dad said some parts were broken. That's why the clock is stopped right now.
    - Seems like there's something inside, but I can't open it.
