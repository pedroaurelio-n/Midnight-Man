Project made in the third semester at Facens University's Game Development course

Development time: February 10th, 2021 - June 9th, 2021


****************************************

Midnight Man is a 2D horror/adventure game where you are stuck in a mansion with a killer spirit and have to find a way to be safe!

Alone in his family's mansion, little Oliver wants someone to play. He decides to do a dark ritual and invoke the Midnight Man to be his new friend, but that didn't turn well since this evil entity is now looking for blood. Explore the mansion, interact with various furniture, gather items and unlock new areas until you find the only thing that can keep you safe from the spirit!

Inspired by old-school RPGMaker horror games, we decide to pay an homage to those titles. We tried our best to capture the tension of being pursued by an unknown entity, the confusion trying to map all the possible locations and the gameplay mechanics of the RPGMaker engine that were recreated from the ground on Unity.
